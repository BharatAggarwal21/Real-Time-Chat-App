# Introduction
A Realtime Chat Application. 
We're going to use React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end. 
The user needs to enter his details and the room he wants to join.
After joining he will be displayed the people currently active in that room and messages by them.

Setup:
run "npm i && npm start" for both client and server side to start the development server.

npm i installs all the packages required for running.
npm start runs the command nodemon index.js and starts the client at localhost:3000 and server at localhost:5000.
